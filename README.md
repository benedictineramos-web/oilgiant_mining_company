# oilgiant_mining_company

A small project for exploratory analysis and basic modeling of oil mining operations. The repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Sprint 9 Project.ipynb`) with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and simple predictive models used for the Sprint 9 deliverable.

Quick notes:
- Language: Python (notebook-based)
- To run: create a Python virtual environment, install common data science packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, jupyter), then open `Sprint 9 Project.ipynb` with Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

If you'd like, I can add a `requirements.txt` or a short example script to reproduce the analyses.
